As a user, I would like to:

- Know the title of an book
- Read a description of the book
- Know when an book was published
- Have a clickable URL so I can download the book
- See an image of the book so I can scroll to look
  for my favorite books
- See the book category

As a developer, I would like to:

- Have a uniquely identifiable attribute for each book
  so I can avoid duplicating books in the database
